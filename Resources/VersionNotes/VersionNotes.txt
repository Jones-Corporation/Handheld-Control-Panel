Version Notes Handheld Control Panel

1.0.0.0 - Released 28-May-2023 on github
	
	Comments:

		Version put at 1.0.0.0 to accomodate the AutoNetUpdater function.

	Fixes:
		
		-Potentially fixed bug where dispatchers were created in non UI classes that were not being disposed of, causing the app to crash.
		-Fixed bug where RTSS hooks dll was being taken from RTSS program files. For non C drive installations this causes error. Uses local dll.
		-Fixed splashscreen spinner not spinning at startup (Thanks to Pakuyasa!)
		-Fixed error where mouse/profile delete prompts don't delete the object.
		-Fixed error where it kept reapplying profile for default profile that has an exe attached to it.
		-Fixed error where default profile and a launched game profile would cycle before starting a game.
		-Fixed error where volume hot keys were not adjusting correctly.
		-Fixed error where mouse mode was allowed to start without an active mouse mode profile.
		-Fixed error when no audio driver is installed, get volume returns an error. Now error traps and hides the volume controls on the home page.
		-Fixed issue where blank records were inserted into resolution/refresh rate lists when editing a profile.
		-Fixed issue where auto fan on startup was reporting as hardware control on the fan control on the home page.
		-Fixed error where windows OSK was crashing HCP when trying to bring up on the screen.
		-Fixed issue where profiles didn't reapply after sleep.
		-Fixed playnite running as admin.
		-Fixed issue notify icon is in task tray after closing. This can cause a "unable to show window error" when clicking the notify icon.

		-Added Playnite directory to app settings.
